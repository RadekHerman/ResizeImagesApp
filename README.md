# ResizeImagesApp

An application I created for my own use. 
I needed the ability to quickly resize large images I receive from clients so I could send them on via email. 
This app does a great job of that, the images are lightweight but maintain very good quality and are perfect for what I need.


## Usage

Users can select multiple images and choose a maximum size (1000 or 1500 px). 
The width or height of the selected image, whichever is larger, is resized to the selected value, and the other is proportionally resized. 
If the image size is not larger than the selected value, the image remains intact.

Resized images are saved to a chosen folder without affecting the originals.
